Hi! I'm Henry, and I'm a senior computer engineering major at Lehigh Univeristy. I love to code, and have aspirations towards the software engineering field.

Here you can find my open source projects, mostly stuff I do for fun on the side as well as projects I have done for undergraduate research.

My website is www.henrywanderson.me
